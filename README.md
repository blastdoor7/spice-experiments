# 🧠 Practical SPICE Experiments

A growing collection of **SPICE simulation files** from my revived electronics workbench —  
radios, amplifiers, condenser microphones, and later, digital circuits.  
Each file is a **self-contained experiment**, fully runnable and documented.

---

## ⚙️ Purpose
An organic notebook of **realistic SPICE circuits** — not polished tutorials,  
but working studies of biasing, saturation, feedback, filters, and analog behavior.

Emphasis on:
- Clear comments and readable circuit structure  
- Real component models (not ideal blocks)  
- Progressive realism — simple to detailed

## ▶️ Usage
All files run in **NGSPICE (v31+)**:

```bash
ngspice path/to/file.cir
